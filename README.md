# HackerRank Solutions
A little about myself: My name is Rodrigo Mejias. I graduated from Claremont McKenna College in May of 2018. In my last year of studies, I found my passion in programming, statistical analysis and data analytics. I graduated with a dual degree in Physics and Economics with a concentration in Scientific Modeling - I believe that my academic base has provided with me wite platform to fully integrate myself into any quantitative or data-related environment and I hope to continue my studies through a combination of programming challenges like HackerRank, online courses such as Lynda, my work experiences and hopefully graduate school in the near future.


I decided to publish my HackerRank programming solutions so that any potential employers can get of sense of how I program, which programming languages I can effectively code in, and hopefully help anyone who is looking for a bit of help on any problem they are working on. I primarily program in Python, R, Excel and SQL - these have tended to be the languages that have been the most versatile and applicable in my undergraduate academic career, but I hope to continue expanding my arsenal and develop new tools to best tackle the task at hand.


Without further ado, here are some quick links and descriptions for my solutions:
